## General provisions

<p align="center">
<b>( article 1 )</b><br>
Mission
</p>

WILLE is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) committed to developing and implementing software tools that promote democracy, call it liquid or digital. These tools make use of remote e-voting and strong identity management in order to be able to achieve on-line consensus. Our action takes place all over the world from developed countries to installed dictatorships; we are here to help humanity achieve its full potential by combating concentration of power and its abuse.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 2 )</b><br>
Name, acronym and symbol
</p>

This DAO is named WILLE inspired by a popular anime series and which stands in German for volition or 'the' will. Colors are white and blue and as a symbol we have a lock and a key in representation of our strong values regarding cybersecurity.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3 )</b><br>
Recognition of the Model Law for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) by the Coalition of Automated Legal Applications
</p>

Considering that at the moment of publication, there is a legal vacuum as regards to how DAOs should be framed in the legal context, worldwide, WILLE endorses the adoption of the Model Law for DAOs<sup>[1](https://www.lextechinstitute.ch/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DAO-Model-Law.pdf)</sup> written by the COALA organization.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4 )</b><br>
On-line discussion platform
</p>

The on-line discussion platform, or on-line platform short, is computer software and the necessary underlying blockchain infrastructure that allows secure exchange of messages and the realization of cheap, fast and reliable on-line referendums between members of the DAO. It also provides the visualization of live video streams of video-conferences and debates and serves as a repository for data necessary to the study of the proposals put forward by DAO members.

I. All the information and tools that are considered important to the functioning of the WILLE DAO are to be readily available for consultation with real-time data whenever possible on the on-line platform.

II. The on-line platform must deploy the most advanced technologies for identity management and secured communications. This includes cryptographic algorithms such as PKI, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Homomorphic Encryption, blockchain, etc., whenever necessary.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4-b )</b><br>
Functionalities
</p>

Through the on-line platform the DAO members are able to:

I. Watch live streams of any debates and video-conferences that may take place during the DAO activities as well as provide access to previous debates at any time and at all levels of the organisation. This functionality can be paired with existing decentralized networks such as IPFS, Odysee or Skynet as examples.

II. DAO members can chat on-line, publish content and rate each others publications. This can be done publicly or in private groups.

III. Members may publish proposals and vote on-line remotely from their own computer in any location. The voting procedure as well as the final tally must be verifiable by the voter while guaranteeing privacy. This is accomplished through cryptography.<sup>[2](https://github.com/partidodigitalpt/documentation/blob/main/Remote%20e-voting%20overview.md)</sup>

IV. Members are able to delegate to other members the ability to vote on a specific proposal or on a category of proposals and retract the delegation at any time. Delegation is transitive unless stated otherwise.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4-c )</b><br>
Discussion forum
</p>

The on-line platform has a specific view; an on-line bulletin board, also known as a forum, to be used for written discourse where:

I. Functionalities mentioned in the previous article 4-b I to IV can be linked to and accessed. Each proposal is automatically assigned a topic.

II. Topics are categorized according to different areas of interest.

III. Moderation is user-centric meaning no special roles are assigned to any user.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 5 )</b><br>
Registration
</p>

The enrolment in the DAO is an individual choice and requires the investment of a minimum sum in cryptocurrency and a passphrase given by one of WILLE's members. Raw biometric data is never to be kept in any database.

I. Adherence to or withdrawal from the DAO is made exclusively through the on-line platform. Registries are published and managed in a decentralized database (blockchain).

<p align="center">
<b>( article 5-b )</b><br>
Anonymity
</p>

Membership is anonymous.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 6 )</b><br>
Incompatibility regime
</p>

DAO members may hold no more than one position within the DAO official structures unless stated otherwise.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 7 )</b><br>
Rights and duties of DAO members
</p>

It is the right of members of the DAO to participate in all activities and bodies, to formulate any suggestion or criticism that may be deemed convenient or to publish new proposals or changes to existing ones. Everything should be doable with the support of the on-line platform. Alternatively, WILLE welcomes paper-based proposals and referendums.

I. Decisions at all levels are to be made by democratic consensus.

II. Every member of the DAO has the right to elect and be elected to any of the DAO’s organs.

III. The right to be informed in a transparent and clear way about all economical activities of the DAO.

IV. Members are entitled free access to all documents ratified by DAO bodies that result from meetings, workings and  internal referendums held during the normal functioning of the DAO. The information must be available in digital format in the on-line platform.

V. It is duty to perform with zeal, assiduity and loyalty to the other members the positions, functions and workings entrusted by them.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 8 )</b><br>
Works
</p>

DAO members are invited to contribute to the elaboration, execution and supervision of a myriad of projects related to the mission of WILLE. To be eligible, members must inform the DAO of the availability and area of expertise through the on-line platform.

I. By signing up as volunteers and depending on the academic background, members are able to execute tasks and perform jobs in representation of WILLE which can be recompensated monetarily.

II. The adjudication, management and supervision of the works are of the responsibility of various ethical committees, or angels.

III. The acceptance of a job position within the DAO requires the signing of a contract, either digitaly or in paper, between WILLE and the contributor. Because there is no legal standards around this practice, we recommend the adoption of an equivalent of the DAO Contributor Agreement<sup>[3](https://github.com/LarryFlorio/LegalForms/blob/main/DAO-Contributor-Agmt/DAO%20Contributor%20Agreement.md)</sup> published by Larry Florio that may seem appropriate.

IV. Conditions for eligibility for the execution tasks and jobs, sources of financing and the procedures for the payments are established in Chapter IV – Smart-contracts.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 9 )</b><br>
Withdrawal
</p>

Membership withdrawal can be done at any time without any prejudice and with immediate effect.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 10 )</b><br>
Penalties
</p>

By going against these by-laws to which members of the DAO agreed upon joining, WILLE members may be alerted or have their membership retracted for a temporary period or, for repeated misbehaviour or inexcusable situations such as; attempt to attack the informatic system or publishing inappropriate content into the on-line platform, the membership status may be revoked permanently. The decision to expel a DAO member is made by democratic consensus on the on-line platform where every member is granted equal vote:

I. Not partaking in DAO's activities by voting directly or by delegating the right to vote for a period longer than 180 days.

II. By not respecting the deadlines and tasks that were entrusted by the DAO and accepted by the member, the membership may be revoked temporarily for a period of up to 1 year.

III. Publishing pornography, inciting to any kind of physical violence or any form of hate speech against minorities be it of ethnographical origin, attacking normal sexual orientation (hetero-homo-bi) or making false accusations against other members may be reason enough to be banned for a period longer than 1 year.

IV. It's considered sufficient reason to ban a member from the DAO if unjustified false information is uploaded to the on-line platform.

V. It’s the responsibility of the ethical committees (angels) to develop mechanisms that contribute to the evaluation of the situations described above and to publish alerts on the on-line platform whenever it may be considered appropriate to do so.

VI. In case of expulsion from WILLE a minimum value equivalent to the initial cryptocurrency invested by the expeled member is returned to the same.

## Deliberative criteria

<p align="center">
<b>( article 1 )</b><br>
Democraticity
</p>

All internal decision-making from the choice of members that participate in the WILLE organs to the choice of proposals that are to be implemented must be based on democratic criteria, namely, being elected or approved by simple consensus or positional majority through direct voting and ranked with a reputation metric. These algorithms are transparent in the sense that they run on smart-contracts on the blockchain.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 2 )</b><br>
Events
</p>

The announcement of the venue and the sending of invitations for the participation on all WILLE’s activities is done automatically by the on-line platform with extra contacts to be made by mail and e-mail (from the WILLE’s headquarters official addresses to the member’s official contacts whenever possible).

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3 )</b><br>
Proposals
</p>

Any DAO member can publish a new proposal or propose changes to existing proposals by using the forums on the on-line platform. The proposals must consist of a title, an abstract and a body:

I. The title must be a short phrase associated with the proposal with a maximum of 30 words.

II. The abstract should also briefly explain the subject to which it refers, and consist of between 100 and 300 words.

III. The body, without limitations, must contain the proposal itself as detailed as possible with the appropriate legal terms preferably. Attached to it may be added documents, images, PDF files, etc., other file formats that convey fundamental information to the understanding and elaboration of the proposal at hand.

IV. If vote turnout is consistently low, proposals by members of WILLE with exception to KREDIT should be approved by adaptive quorom biasing with positive turnout bias. Otherwise always by simple majority.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3-b )</b><br>
Rate of approval
</p>

Through the on-line platform on the forum view members of the DAO can express and register in an encrypted distributed and signed digital database if they approve or reject a proposal or amendment of an existing policy put forward by other members.

I. We define local rate of approval as the reason between the  approvals for a given policy and the total number of users that share the same nationality.

II. The global rate of approval is a numerical variable calculated by the reason between the number of approvals and the total number of members of the DAO.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3-c )</b><br>
Urgency
</p>

Parallel to the indicator defined above, DAO members are invited to classify a given policy according to how urgent they consider it to be; irrelevant, of little importance, useful, important and urgent.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3-d )</b><br>
Impact
</p>

I. Low impact proposals are those whose financing doesn’t exceed 1/1000000?th of the WILLE's treasury and are prioritized up to of little importance.

II. Ordinary proposals are those whose financing is lower than 1/100000?th of the WILLE's treasury or that are considered from useful or impactful.

III. Medium-impact proposals are those whose financing costs are greater than 1/10000?th of the WILLE's treasury and whose priority is considered useful or impactful.

IV. High-impact proposals are considered to be all whose financing is greater than 1/1000?th of the WILLE's treasury or whose priority is considered urgent.

<b>( article 3-e )</b><br>
Evaluation period
</p>

The proposal evaluation period is an evaluation period of 3 months during which the proposals are to be discussed amongst the DAO members and the various bodies before being officially accepted and implemented through smart-contracts.

I. The KREDIT may, by simple consensus, shorten the evaluation time for a given bill to a period no shorter than 1 month, if it is considered necessary to make urgent decisions. 

II. Analogously to the previous point, the evaluation period of a proposal can be extended to a maximum of 1 year by the KREDIT with simple majority consensus if it consideres necessary a more thorough study of the socio-economic impacts of the policy proposal or the capacity to execute accordingly is in question.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3-f )</b><br>
Quadratic funding</p>

Medium to high impact proposals should whenever possible be grouped in quadratic funding rounds.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3-h )</b><br>
Veto</p>

Angels can veto proposals.

## Smart-contracts

<p align="center">
<b>( article 1 )</b><br>
Transparency
</p>

The WILLE DAO has in its genesis the principle of transparency, that is, all decision-making, meetings, debates and internal procedures are always public.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 2 )</b><br>
Financing
</p>

Financing of the activities of the WILLE is made by:

I. Voluntary contributions made in cryptocurrency by anyone to a wallet address.

II. Shareholders must transfer a minimum and a maximum value of cryptocurrency in order to aquire full membership.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 2-b )</b><br>
Contributions
</p>

Membership and participation in the WILLE’s bodies is always free of additional charges only requiring the payment of the membership fee. However, DAO members are welcomed to give contributions by sending cryptocurrency to the WILLE DAO’s wallet address. These contributions are to be publicly announced on the DAO’s official website and a special badge is given under the forum’s avatar of the donator in the on-line platform for a period.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3 )</b><br>
Cryptocurrency
</p>

The cryptocurrency that is to be used by the DAO is eth, the native cryptocurrency supported by Ethereum 2’s main-net.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4 )</b><br>
Financial report
</p>

Because WILLE runs on a dApp supported by blockchain financial reporting and accounting can be done automatically by a computer algorithm. In fact every proposal and transfer of money from WILLE's treasury is properly recorded and accounted for. Thus we require a monthly publication on the official website of DAO and through the on-line platform:

I. A monthly provisional trial balance published at the beggining of each month.

II. A real trial balance published at the end of each month.

III. An annual financial report. (elaborate)
